Context: On our Shows → Calendar View page, FullCalendar’s default time‐grid rows are very tall. We want to see more of each day at once—especially between business hours—without needing to scroll.

Goal: Adjust the FullCalendar configuration and/or add custom CSS so that each half‐hour (or 15‐minute) row is significantly shorter. We should be able to pack more hours vertically, while still preserving readability (time labels and event blocks should not overlap).

Requirements:

Slot height reduction

Override FullCalendar’s default CSS so that each time‐slot cell is only ~24px tall (instead of the default ~40–48px).

For example, target .fc-timegrid-slot (and related cells) and apply a reduced min-height or height rule.

Ensure event blocks (.fc-timegrid-event) also shrink proportionally so they still fill their slots.

slotDuration & snapDuration

Keep slotDuration="00:30:00" but optionally allow slotDuration="00:15:00" if we want finer granularity.

Adjust snapDuration="00:15:00" accordingly if using 15-minute slots.

slotLabelInterval (optional)

Instead of showing a label for every half‐hour, label only on the hour or every 2 hours (e.g., slotLabelInterval="01:00").

This reduces clutter while fitting more rows.

Visible hours

If business hours are 8 am–10 pm, set slotMinTime="08:00:00" and slotMaxTime="22:00:00" so midnight/early‐morning rows are hidden.

This focuses vertical space on relevant hours.

Custom CSS with Tailwind + CSS variables

Use Tailwind’s @layer components or a global CSS file to override FullCalendar variables:

css
Copy
Edit
@layer components {
  /* shrink each half‐hour slot to ~24px */
  .fc-timegrid-slot {
    min-height: 24px !important;
    height: 24px !important;
  }
  /* shrink event blocks to match slot height */
  .fc-timegrid-event {
    line-height: 1.2;
  }
  /* adjust the gutter (time labels) width if necessary */
  .fc-timegrid-axis-cushion {
    font-size: 0.75rem;
  }
}
Ensure these classes respect both light and dark mode CSS variables (e.g. background colors, border colors).

Maintain responsiveness & accessibility

On mobile or small screens, allow FullCalendar to scroll vertically as needed, but still use the same compact slot height.

Keep time labels legible: don’t shrink font below 0.75rem.

Deliverables:

Update FullCalendarView (or wherever <FullCalendar> is rendered) so that:

It uses slotMinTime="08:00:00" and slotMaxTime="22:00:00" by default.

It still shows initialView="timeGridWeek".

It includes new CSS rules (either in a global stylesheet or via Tailwind’s @layer components) that override .fc-timegrid-slot and related selectors, reducing row height to ~24px.

Optionally set slotLabelInterval="01:00" to label only the hour marks.

Confirm that after these changes, the week/day view displays more hours at once (e.g. nine hours visible without scroll), and event blocks still align correctly.

Provide any new CSS/Tailwind additions in a single cohesive snippet.

Use Tailwind’s utility syntax and CSS‐variable theming so that the condensed time rows look consistent with our app’s modern, light/dark aesthetic. If additional FullCalendar options or plugins are required (e.g. slotLabelInterval), include them.
